# automatic_street_lightning

The Automatic Street Lighting System employs an LDR module, relay, Arduino Nano, LED light, and dual power supplies (AC for the bulb, DC for Arduino). LDR module senses ambient light, Arduino Nano processes data, triggering the relay to control LED light activation. The system ensures efficient energy usage by automatically adjusting streetlight illumination based on ambient light conditions. It enhances urban safety and sustainability through IoT-enabled smart lighting solutions.
