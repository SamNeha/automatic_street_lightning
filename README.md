The Automatic Street Lighting System utilizes an LDR module to sense ambient light, an Arduino Nano to process data, and a relay to control LED light activation. This IoT-enabled solution optimizes energy usage by adjusting streetlight illumination based on environmental conditions, enhancing urban safety and sustainability.
